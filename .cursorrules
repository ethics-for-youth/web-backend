# Project Overview
This is a serverless AWS Lambda backend for Ethics For Youth (EFY) platform.
Built with Node.js, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and Terraform for infrastructure.

# Architecture
- Serverless: AWS Lambda functions for all API endpoints
- Database: DynamoDB for data persistence
- API Gateway: REST API with public endpoints
- Infrastructure: Terraform for infrastructure as code
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated deployment

# Key Technologies
- Node.js 18.x - 20.x
- AWS SDK v3
- DynamoDB DocumentClient
- Terraform >= 1.0
- GitHub Actions

# Code Style
- Use ES6+ features
- Consistent error handling with utility functions
- AWS SDK v3 patterns
- Terraform best practices
- RESTful API design

# Security
- No authentication implemented (all endpoints are public)
- CORS enabled for web frontend access
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Environment variables for configuration

# File Structure
- lambda_functions/: Individual Lambda functions
- layers/: Shared code and dependencies
- terraform/: Infrastructure as code
- scripts/: Build and deployment scripts
- docs/: API documentation

# Important Notes
- All Lambda functions use utility layer at /opt/nodejs/utils
- Environment variables are set by Terraform
- CORS headers are included in all responses
- Error responses follow consistent format
